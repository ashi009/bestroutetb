Best Route Table
================

**NEW [check out][npmver] npm compliant version**

**新 [查看][npmver] npm 兼容版本**

----

Inspired by [chnroutes][chnroutes].

This project aimed to generate the smallest route table,
while preserves the minimalist requirements that IPs of
specified countries or subnets will be routed to a
specified gateway (default or VPN).

Generally speaking, the generated route table is at least
70% smaller than chnroutes's.

Objective
---------

I started this project due to the huge route table
generated by *chnroutes* doesn't fit into my router.

Which takes almost 4 minutes to load up, and it cannot be
put into OpenVPN"s configuration file for my service
provider pushed `ping-reset 60` to the client, reseted
OpenVPN before route table being loaded up.

So I decided to minimize the route table.


How efficient it is?
-------------------

For a example, a route table that route all IPs in China to
default gateway, and US, GB, Japan, Hong kong administered 
IPs to VPN gateway (based on 4/8/2013 data,)
only need 1164 routing directives, while *chnroutes* needs
3589 routing directives.

Which is **70% smaller**. And if route US address to VPN only,
the route table has only **99 directives**, which is less than
2% of original size.

On Linux system, which usese [TRASH][trash] structure to store
routing table, a route lookup operation expected to access
memory O(loglog _n_) times. Using *bestroutetb* over *chnroutes*,
will reduce at least 0.01 accesses expectedly. (This is joking!
But it does reduce the route table size in memory for 70% by
assuming TRASH structure is using a very small overhead
hash implementation, which is significant. So this solution works 
especially well on those routers don't have lots of free memory.)


How it works
------------

Unlike *chnroutes*, which will generate a route table that
route all IPs of china to default gateway, while other
IPs to VPN gateway.  This project divides IPs in three
groups. First group is guaranteed to be routed to default
gateway, Second group is guaranteed to be routed to VPN
gateway. And the last group will be dynamically assigned
to one of the gateways, in a manner that will generate
the smallest route table.

To achieve the goal, this project using dynamic programming
algorithm to find out the most optimized route table.

We can prove that, the generated route table is the smallest
one based on the given restrictions.

Dependencies
------------

This project is mainly written in JavaScript, and some in Bash.
So you will need *node.js* to run the scripts.

  * [node.js][nodejs]

Bash code is relatively simple, and could be re-written in Batch
(in future.) But either way it needs *wget* to download the
latest IP delegation file for now.

  * [wget][wget]


How to use
----------

### Quick start

    ./generate.sh route_table > analysis_result

Which will output the routing directives (OpenVPN syntax) to
`route_table` and a summarized evaluation report to `analysis_result`.

The syntax for this script is:

    ./generate.sh output [options]

Where

  * `output` is the path of output route table.
  * `options` will be redirected to `./minifier.js` and `./formatter.js`.


### Generating Rules

    node minifier.js [--net=SPECS] [--vpn=SPECS]

Where

  * `--net` is used to specify a list of country abbreviations and
    IP subnets to be routed to default gateway. Default to `CN`.
  * `--vpn` is used to specify a list of country abbreviations and IP
    subnets to be routed to VPN gateway. Default to `US,GB,JP,HK`.
  * `SPECS` is a list separated with comma(,) of country abbreviation
    names, IP subnets or the path to a file of `SPECS`.
    Note that, the abbreviation names can be found in `res/countrynames`,
    and paths in file won't be followed.

This script will output rules in *JSON* to `stdout`, and statistic
info to `stderr`, so please redirect `stdout` to a file.  Recommend
use `generate.sh` instead.

JSON structure:

    [
      Rule,
      ...
    ]

`Rule` structure:

    {
      "prefix": "dest",
      "mask": "netmask",
      "length", netmaskLength,
      "gw": "net|vpn"
    }

Example:

    node minifier.js --net=128.8.0.0/16 --vpn=specs

Where `specs` contains:

    # Country list
    GB
    # IP list
    8.0.0.0/8
    123.4.5.6 # this is a host

Outputs:

    [{
      "prefix": "0.0.0.0",
      "mask": "0.0.0.0",
      "length": 0,
      "gw": "vpn"
    }, {
      "prefix": "128.0.0.0",
      "mask": "255.240.0.0",
      "length": 12,
      "gw": "net"
    }]
    Total: 2 rules

### Formatting a rules file

    node formatter.js [input] [--profile=PROFILE]
        [--header=HEADER] [--footer=FOOTER]
        [--format=FORMAT] [--netgw=NETGW] [--vpngw=VPNGW]
        [--nodefaultgw=1]
        [--groupgw=GROUPGW]
        [--groupheader=GROUPHEADER] [--groupfooter=GROUPFOOTER]
        [arguments]

Where

  * `input` is the path to JSON format rule file, if omitted, `stdin` will be used.
  * `--profile` chosen between `openvpn`, `route_up`, `route_down`, `iproute_up`,
    `iproute_down`, `win_up`, `win_down`, `ppp_ip_up`, `custom`. Default to `openvpn`.
  * `--header` header of the output file.
  * `--footer` footer of the output file.
  * `--format` string used to format a rule when `--profile=custom`. You can use
    `%prefix`, `%mask`, `%length`, and `%gw` to correspond fields in a rule.
    You may also use other variables (`%[a-zA-Z]\w*`) which are passed in in
    `arguments`.
  * `--netgw` `%gw` for `"gw": "net"` rules, when *not* using `--profile=openvpn`.
  * `--vpngw` `%gw` for `"gw": "vpn"` rules, when *not* using `--profile=openvpn`.
  * `--nodefaultgw` don't output directive for default route (0.0.0.0/0).
  * `--groupgw` group rules by gateway. Useful when you want rules to be outputed
    in two parts, say two functions for each interface. Default to `1` when
    `--profile=ppp_ip_up`, otherwise `0`.
  * `--netgroupname` `%name` for `"gw": "net"` rules, when `--groupgw=1`.
  * `--vpngroupname` `%name` for `"gw": "vpn"` rules, when `--groupgw=1`.
  * `--groupheader` header of each group. Note that, which could include `%name` to
    identify group.
  * `--groupfooter` footer of each group. Note that, which could include `%name` to
    identify group.
  * `arguments` a group of arguments to be used in `format` (eg. add `--var="value"` to
    `arugments`, then use `%var` for `value` in `--format`.)

Example:

    node formatter.js rules.json
    # or node minifier.js --vpn=us | node formatter.js

Outputs:

    Total: 99 rules
    route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 vpn_gateway
    route 0.0.0.0 254.0.0.0 net_gateway
    route 1.0.16.0 255.255.240.0 vpn_gateway
    route 1.0.64.0 255.255.192.0 vpn_gateway
    route 1.1.64.0 255.255.192.0 vpn_gateway
    route 1.5.0.0 255.255.0.0 vpn_gateway
    route 1.16.0.0 255.248.0.0 vpn_gateway
    route 1.32.0.0 255.248.0.0 vpn_gateway
    route 1.64.0.0 255.252.0.0 vpn_gateway
    route 1.72.0.0 255.248.0.0 vpn_gateway
    route 1.112.0.0 255.252.0.0 vpn_gateway
    ...

### Analysing a rules file

    node evaluator.js [input] [--verbose=1] [--defaultgw=DEFAULT]

Where

  * `input` is the path to JSON format rule file, if omitted, `stdin` will be used.
  * `--verbose` when set will output the route result for every block.
    Default not set.
  * `--defaultgw` is the gateway for 0.0.0.0/0.
